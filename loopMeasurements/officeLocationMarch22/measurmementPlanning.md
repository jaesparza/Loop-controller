## Planning the measurements

Conducting measurements:
* [ ] For each range to measure, calibrate the device.
* [ ] For each band measurements one file: bandNameDate.
* Guideline: Measure in steps of 1kHz
* Date in format DayMonthYear in two digit format: e.g. 20m120222 for 20m band measured on the 12 of Feb year 2022
* For each measurement, log: "Sweep in X segments, YYYY Hz/step"


Perform measurments for the following bands:

### 20m | 14MHz
* 14.000 - Measure at the lowest usable frequency of the band
* 14.175
* 14.350

bandwidth 350 kHz

[ ] Measurements in file 20m260322

### 17m | 18 MHz
* 18.068
* 18.118 Measure
* 18.168

bandwidth 100 kHz

[ ] Measurements in file 17m260322

Sweep in  segments,  Hz/step

### 15m | 21 MHz
* 21.000
* 21.225 Measure
* 21.450

bandwidth 450 kHz

[ ] Measurements in file 15m260322

Sweep in  segments,  Hz/step

### 12m | 24 MHz
* 24.890
* 24.940 Measure
* 24.990

bandwidth 100 kHz

[ ] Measurements in file 12m260322

Sweep in  segments,  Hz/step

### 10m | 28 MHz
* 28.000
* 29.700 - Measure the highest usable frequency of the band

bandwidth 1700 kHz

[ ] Measurements in file 10m260322
