## Planning the measurements

Conducting measurements:
* [X] For each range to measure, calibrate the device.
* [X] For each band measurements one file: bandNameDate.
* Guideline: Measure in steps of 1kHz (at least)
* Date in format DayMonthYear in two digit format: e.g. 20m120222 for 20m band measured on the 12 of Feb year 2022

Perform measurments for the following bands:

### 20m | 14MHz
* 14.000 - Measurement center, span 700 kHz, 500 points
* 14.175
* 14.350

bandwidth 350 kHz

[X] Measurements in file 20m310322

### 17m | 18 MHz
* 18.068
* 18.118 Measure
* 18.168

bandwidth 100 kHz

[X] Measurements in file 17m260322


### 15m | 21 MHz
